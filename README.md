My notes. Written with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Website written using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

You can access the hosted version of the webiste [here](https://abban-fahim.github.io/notes/). You can also open it locally in Obsidian by cloning the repository, and opening the folder `src/content/studies` as a vault. 

To use it fully, you will have to clone my patched version of the waypoint plugin for obsidian (instructions to be added soon...).
