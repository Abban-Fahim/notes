			<h1>Abban's notes <p style="display: inline;"><a href="/">(home)</a></p></h1>
			<p>This website is a collection of (almost) all of my notes and thoughts about courses I take, as well as topics that interest me.</p>
			<p>Most of them come from my undergraduate courses at Heriot-Watt university, where I'm studying robotics. The rest are from various courses and notes available online (cited as needed).</p>
			<p>Also note that these may be VERY incomplete, and if you find any formatting errors/incomplete/incorrect information, please don't hesitate to open an issue.</p>
