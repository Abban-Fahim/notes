## SWOT
- Strengths
	- Directly tackles the sanitation and pubic defecation challenges faced by the entire community
	- Removes select un-recycled garbage from the streets, reducing visual and water pollution and landfills
	- Built with very cheap materials, while ensuring safety standards are met
	- Small single units - can be built across several different locations
- Weaknesses:
	- Prone to being vandalised and defaced
	- Is not financially self reliant - requires municipal funding
- Opportunities:
	- Raise awareness about sanitation and personal hygiene
	- Collaborate with local community projects like Water for Aid to reduce pollution in the river Jukesei
	- Employment for locals in technical construction (carpentry, design etc) and maintenance
- Threats:
	- Theft or destruction of building materials, by natural elements like rain or by humans
	- Loss in sanitation standards due to improper usage
	- Lack of funding may result in poor maintenance, and may lead to any of the above

## PESTLE

Political: collaboration with local government and municipal bodies for funding, regulations and approvals.
Economic: creating jobs for locals in maintenance and construction.
Social: partnering with local companies to create a service that benefits everyone as a community, in terms of having cleaner streets, lower risks of disease outbreak, etc.
Technological: using recycling technology to create a durable and cheap construction material.
Legal: the sanitation and safety guidelines, and building codes to be complied with for constructing our units; implications of having contracts with the local government and other recycling bodies.
Environmental: removes waste plastic from water bodies and the environment. Provides a safe and clean place for defecation, ensuring human waste does not leech into water bodies or create unpleasant odours. 

As team leader, most of my work involved organizing the team, setting and enforcing deadlines, and consolidating everyone’s work. I created the design of the entire poster and extracted every member’s written work to fit inside, as well as ensure everyone's presentation speeches were consistent. The same work had to be done for the final report, as well as correcting everyone's work to make it logically consistent and presentable, and collect together all the references. Before every meeting, I also set the agenda, and managed all the communication with our supervisor. My individual tasks were to create the 3D model of our prototype, create a suitable introduction, abstract, and conclusion, as well as most of the project planning details, and the SWOT and PESTLE analysis. I also helped in research into safety considerations, doing calculations according to BS-EN standards, and did part of the economics analysis.

My journey with this course has been a bitter-sweet one, filled with multiple tribulations and feats. The course content itself was very insightful, and it was a welcoming challenge of understanding project economics and planning, as it was not something I had expected to learn in such detail, or though that I would need to. While my preferred career choice lies towards technical research and development, some of this knowledge has helped immensely in understanding how and why projects fails, what investors look for, and how to appeal to them. It also helped me in writing my first ever funding proposal, for a project outside the course, and having it accepted. Next, the course's exploration of sustainability in engineering was a much less challenging subject scientifically, but very insightful in how it is applied to business contexts. As climate change and social equality are issues that are close to me at a personal level, it was useful to be able to discuss and debate about them in an academic setting. It also taught me more about how to critically think about environmental, social and economic implications of any product or design, and it was something I applied in this course the team project, and plan to apply across my future projects as well.

This team project was also the more difficult task in the course, but one that I took on with enthusiasm and chose to lead. It taught me invaluable lessons about working with people of different technical backgrounds, and how gruelling the storming phase of a team can be, as well as how to eventually finish it. The project also gave me an insight in how to work with people who do not match the same enthusiasm as you, a skill that I falsely believed I already had. This is the tribulations part of project where I found even myself lacking the motivation to continue and deliver an exceptional project, but it taught me how to ultimately pull through and get work done.

To conclude, this course and especially the project have allowed me to improve my nuance and knowledge when it comes to economics and sustainability, and also my team-working, leadership, and presentation skills, which I believe and hope will be invaluable for my career and life after graduation and beyond.
