My passion for creating originates from playing, and eventually making, video games as a child. It was also the first place I met Artificial Intelligence (AI), albeit in a primitive form in the early 2010s, which fascinated me and created questions in my head: how does this work? how can it be better?

This thirst for knowledge led me down a path of academic prowess

To me the process, of research is a art. As a robotics student who is still exploring the vast , this programme is essentially. I also believe that in my field, industry and research are closely intertwined, and whichever path I take will not affect the journey, which is one of constant learning, trying out new technology and communicating these experiments.



As a student with a strong interest in robotics and machine vision, I believe that in this field, industry and research are closely intertwined. It is also a relatively new field, and has a very large potential, of which I hope to be part of and contribute to. In this internship I hope to gain experience in doing original research, and accelerate me from just literature reviews and writing essays, into scientific deduction, and one day, discovery.

As for why I am interested in robotics, the story starts from my childhood interests in video-games. They gave me my first primitive experience of AI and how much was possible. Later on, my main prowess was in academics, especially mathematics and natural sciences, all the while I taught myself how to work with computers and Linux, how to code and develop games and web apps. These factors ultimately affected my decision of choosing engineering as my major, while specialising in autonomous systems, as I could use my self-acquired skills and apply them in a challenging scientific field.

During my past two and a half years, I have proactively looked for opportunities and projects to apply and gain experience in this field. Through our engineering society, I learned many practical skills usually reserved to mechanical and manufacturing engineers, and participated in numerous competitions. My team was the winner of the inaugural A2RL STEM competition, and my coursework projects have always involved a considerable amount of researching algorithms and mathematical techniques to solve problems. One these is an ongoing research project and competition, funded by the Mubadala group, to design and build an autonomous surface cleaning USV.

My most significant contact with the robotics research community was at my participation at IROS 2024, held in Abu Dhabi last year (where I also visited MBZUAI!). There I was not only reaffirmed of my career choice, but was inspired by all the authors, speakers, and demonstrations. The highlight of that conference for me was my discovery of neuromorphic computing and event cameras, introduced by Prof. Scaramuzza's talk and talking to authors of papers on the topic. I immediately saw the advantages of their asynchronous nature, and how they relate to real animal vision, and realised their potential in the future of vision-based autonomy. This sub-field of vision then became the content of all my reading till now, and is what I hope to address the gaps of knowledge in this internship, and my academic and professional career beyond.
