Volunteering at Heriot Watt's climate hub was a long and challenging, but ultimately very rewarding experience. Some of the skills that I honed during the past two weeks are:

- clearly speaking with large groups of people during very busy influxes and answering queries about products
- conveying technical products, engineering concepts and their relationships with sustainability to audiences of all ages (middle schoolers up to senior professionals), who had varying fields of expertise
- acquiring in-depth knowledge about real products in order to explain them to audiences of guests and delegates, as well as provide technical assistance in setting up and using demonstration units

There were also many treasured moments that were just as invaluable to my confidence and experience, including:

- meeting His Majesty, King Charles, and the First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, and even more people with prestigious positions, and conversing with them on the topics of sustainability and technology
- networking with and learning from researchers and entrepreneurs in various fields of engineering, like energy and robotics, hence gaining insight into practical life and work in my field of study.
