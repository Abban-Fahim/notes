So our activity will be a set of trivia questions, related to engineering ofcourse. Getting all questions right will win the students a prize. They will be generally easy questions.
We will also be setting up a monitor at our stall, which will show off some videos about our club, and is required for setting up one of our robots. About the robots, they will be used to make our stall more attractive. We will be having a robot dog (remotely controlled) with our insignia on it that will roam around doing tricks. There will also be a manipulator and a larger humanoid robot stationary at our stall to interact with our students. There might also be another small humanoid robot (his name is Nao, u can look it up) which may also be part of the trivia.

Hi I’m Your VP, and while I may speak in code and circuits, I swear I’m the one keeping things grounded!!! No need to worry, I only short-circuit when there's a coffee shortage--Ann
