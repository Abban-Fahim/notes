The ADEP programme gave me a jump start into higher education by providing me with a more prompt route into university and equipping me with the crucial set of skills entailing me to succeed in my journey. The English and APL courses were significantly distinct, yet all the same fascinating, to what I had been earlier exposed to. They were engrossed in transferrable skills like speaking and academic writing, which became very useful for uni assignments. 
Coming from IGCSEs, I found the technical topics taught in maths and physics strenous to grasp in such a brief period, however the teachers were hospitable and ready to help, especially through the Maths Gym initiative, and ensured that I could keep up with the learning, that became essential for the engineering courses I would take later.
