These algorithms take the classic evolutionary 

A GP representation may be described with two dependant characteristics
- expressiveness is how much complex behaviour it can describe
- evolvibality

usually there is a tradeoff

## Koza

high-level languages
high expr, low evol

## Cartesian

uses grids, learns links between them, used to evolve circuits represented as an FGPA
low expr, high evol

## Linear

low-level instructions for a programme
very low expr, med evol

## Grammatical evoultion

used with formal grammar

## Genetic improvement
