Fundamentally, it is an optimisation problem. You

## Classification

The simplest problem that is usually solved 

## Supervised learning

This type of learning requires a dataset, $\mathbb{D}=\set{X,Y}$, where $X$ is your input data, and $Y$ is its corresponding label. The loss function is dependant on a vector of parameters $\theta$, and the optimisation is formulated by

$$\Theta=\argmin_{\theta}{(x,y,\theta)}$$
