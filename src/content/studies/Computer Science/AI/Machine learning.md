Fundamentally, it is an optimisation problem, which is solved using a large amount of data, and provides us with a model that can be used for prediction with new data as input. Like any optimisation, an objective function must be minimised, the arguments of which are the parameters of your model, that is the minimum number of values needed to define your model of choice. The choice of model, and the algorithm used to optimise it, is derived from the problem you are trying to solve, some of which are listed below. 

## Classification

The simplest problem that is usually solved 

## Regression

## Supervised learning

This type of learning requires a dataset, $\mathbb{D}=\set{X,Y}$, where $X$ is your input data, and $Y$ is its corresponding label. The loss function is dependant on a vector of parameters $\theta$, and it is usually computed as some sort of average of the differency between the predicted values, and the label values.
