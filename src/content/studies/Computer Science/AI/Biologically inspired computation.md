(I believe) the motivation behind perform computation in ways that are approximately like biological organisms is to investigate and replicate how life manages to solve difficult problems and show intelligence in different ways. This ranges from how well organisms are able to adapt to dynamic environments, devise optimal ways to survive, and how they evolve over generations to adapt even better. 

An adaptive system is one that in face of perturbations maintains an invariant, either by changing itself or the environment, with the invariant usually being related to its survival. Adaptation is the measure of how well an agent is learning, and becoming more intelligent. Computational systems are made up of two distinct pieces: models and algorithms. A model is an abstraction of a more complex system, and its workings, inputs and outputs can be observed, and are that. Algorithms are
