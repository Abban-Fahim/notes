0The quantity that describes the effect of a magnetic field is **flux**, $\Phi$, and is measured in webers, $Wb$, which in SI units is voltage-seconds. The **flux density** is measured in, Teslas, $T$, and is defined as pressure or density of flux

$$
B=\frac{\Phi}{A}
$$

Experimental observations also show that it is proportional to current, $i$, and inversely to distance away from conductor. This can be compared relative to the flux in air to find one of the constants of proportionality, giving us an index for **permeability**, where $\mu_{r}$ for air is 1

$$
\mu_{r}=\frac{\mu}{\mu_{0}}
$$

and $\mu_{0}=4\pi\cdot{10^{-7}}\text{ H/m}$ the gravitational constant, or the permeability of vacuum/air. This can be used together with the **magneto-motive force**, $F=Ni$, that is an equivalent concept of e.m.f and voltage where $N$ is the number of wires in a core, and with the length of the magnetic circuit (circumference of iron core) to give us

$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0}\mu_{r}Ni}{2\pi{r}}
$$

In fact, flux and m.m.f with a concept called **reluctance**, $S$, form a Ohm's law relation together

$$
Ni=\Phi{S}
$$

$$
S=\frac{l}{\mu_{0}\mu_{r}A}
$$

A common graphical representation of the permeability is given in B-H curves, where $H$ is the magnetising force or magnetic intensity, and modelled as

$$
H=\frac{B}{\mu_{0}\mu_{r}}
$$
