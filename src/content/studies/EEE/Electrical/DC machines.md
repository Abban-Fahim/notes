# Motors

The axle is the mechanical thingy we will not care about, inside the motor. The next part is the rotor, which contains rotating commutators with gaps between them. These gaps allow the current to alternate in polarity every half-rotation, and there are brushes that provide current from the power source. The armature is 

## Types of winding

### Lap

$$c=2p$$

### Wave

$$c=2$$

## Useful energy

The armature always has a certain amount of (small) resistance, and the current provided to the motor

$$E=\frac{2pZN_{r}\phi}{60c}$$
