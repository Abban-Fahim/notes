For motor movement, the right-hand rule is used, with force being propotional as

$$F=Bil$$

For a conductor in a field moving with velocity $v$, the induced e.m.f is

$$E=Bvl\sin{\theta}$$

A change in current in the primary of a transformer induced an e.m.f in the secondary, with a constant of mutual coupling $M$

$$E=M\frac{di}{dt}$$

This $M$ is related to the losses in the transformer, with $k$ being the ratio of flux and $L$ being the inductance in each circuit

$$k=\frac{\phi_{1}}{\phi_{2}}$$
$$M=k\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}}$$

For energy conservation, we can assume the following

$$P_{1}=P_{2}$$
$$\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}=\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}=\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}$$
