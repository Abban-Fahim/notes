Speed and load-torque relations:

- Forward drive: positive (anti-clockwise) motor movement, and its torque is the same. If the load torque is in the opposite direction, the load has a resultant force in the direction of the motor.
- Braking: also the same motor movement, but the load torque is in the same direction as the movement, causing the resultant motor torque to be in the opposite direction as the motor's movement.
- Reverse drive

## Belt drive

## Transportation drive

These mechanical systems have very high moments of inertia requires a larger torque to get them moving initially. To minimise the time taken to drive between stations, the positive and negative accelerations must be maximised, as well as the cruising speed. The maximum magnitude of either acceleration is dictated by passenger comfort.

To compute torque

$$T_{m}=\frac{rman}{n_{1}}$$
$$T_{\omega}=n_{2}$$
$$T_{G}=$$
$$T_{R}=\frac{20rmn}{10^{3}n_{1}}$$

## Components of load

There is a component of frictional torque present no matter the speed of the motor, known as Coulomb torque, $T_{C}$. The viscous frictional torque, $T_{B}$, is proportional the speed of the motor and given with a constant as $T_{B}=B\omega$. The final component is standstill torque, $T_{S}$, which is high at initial low torques, and decreases as the load is in motion.

There is also Windage torque caused by shafts moving in fluids, and lastly we have the inertial torque to start objects moving, given by

$$T_{J}=I\frac{d\omega}{dt}$$

## Steady state stability

Equilibrium of a motor system occurs when the (supplied) motor torque equal to the load torque.

## Load equalisation

When load torque fluctuates too much too often, the motor will draw pulses of current, and causing fluctuation in the line voltage, which is not good.
