## Types of power

Power in alternating voltages does not work conventionally, as when sinusoids are averaged, the result is 0. There are three types of "power" that describe power consumption with AC voltages, and all voltage and current amplitudes are used as $V_{rms} = \frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}}$

- active power, $P$

$$P = I^{2}R \;\;\ (\text{W})$$

- reactive power, $Q$

$$Q = I^{2}X \;\; (\text{VAr})$$

- apparent power, $S$

$$S = I^{2}Z = VI^{*} \;\;\ (\text{VA})$$

These powers are inter-related with a triangle on the Argand diagram

$$S = P + jQ$$

The modulus of S gives us the **apparent power**, and can be defined as 

$$|S| = \sqrt{P^{2}+Q^{2}}$$

## Phase angle and power factor

In reference to the power triangle, the power factor is equal to $\cos{\varphi}$, where $\varphi$ is the angle between apparent and active power

$$\cos{\varphi}=\frac{P}{S}$$
