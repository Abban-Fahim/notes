*Specific gravity*, $\gamma$, is measured relative the the density of water, $\rho_w$

$$
 \gamma = \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_{w}} 
$$

##### Compression

**Liquids** have so little compressibility, they are considered *incompressible*. **Gases** on the other hand can be easily *compressed*
*Bulk modulus of elasticity*, $k$, defines the degree of compressibility of a fluid:

$$
 k = -V \frac{dp}{dV} 
$$

##### Viscosity

The *resisting* effect of fluid against *shearing motion/stress* of layers flowing over another. An **inviscid** fluid has none or negligible viscosity and cannot sustain shearing motion

$$
  \uptau = \frac{F_{shear}}{A} 
$$

For straight parallel motion of a fluid, the *viscosity* is $\mu$

$$
\uptau = \mu \frac{du}{dy} 
$$
