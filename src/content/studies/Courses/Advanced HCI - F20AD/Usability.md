Usability is the measure of the quality of the interaction with a service. A crucial part of this is being accessible, which means to remove barriers of usage between certain demographics. According to an ISO standard, it mainly includes effectiveness (can the user carry out what they wish to), efficiency (how effective the system is, speed wise, smoothness), satisfaction (how the user feels about using)

An example of measuring satisfaction is surveying users, found in government apps, course feedback forms, etc.


When doing evaluation, u need to have a walk through with ur test user, and measure the following (DO THIS WITH UR COURSEWORK)
- deviation from critical path
- error rate
- time taken
- mental workload

possible usability problems
- find-ability: not finding sumn or ur way around it
- cognitive overload: excess info/format
- interaction cost: too many clicks/hard to go back
- inconsistency

TAM defines how and why certain technology is accepted/rejected. SUS is subjective assessment of usability

Disabilities are mismatches between the needs of the individual and the environment/service. Deprivation of basic senses account for a majority of these, and are called physical exclusions. 
Conceptual exclusion is when users can't process
Cognition exclusion includes perception and learning disabilities
Cultural exclusion is when inappropriate assumptions exclude people of certain groups, preferring other ones.

universal design principles
- equitable use
- flexibility use
- simple and intuitive use
- perceptible info
- tolerance for error
- low phyiscal effor
- size and space for approach

security in hcu
- confidentjlity
- integriu
- rt

Must have trade-offs between this and usability
