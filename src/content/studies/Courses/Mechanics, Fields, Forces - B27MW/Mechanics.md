##### SUVAT

Equations of motion with constant acceleration

$$
v = u + at
$$

$$
s= \frac{1}{2} (u+v) t 
$$

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 
$$

$$
s=vt- \frac{1}{2}at^2 
$$

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

$$
a = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\ v = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\ s
$$

$$
s = \int v \ dt = \int a \ dt 
$$

### Angular motion

##### Uniform circular motion

A particle or object may moves in angular motion when they have a centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, of constant magnitude towards a centre $R$ m away, and a constant speed, $v$,

$$
a_c = \frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2} 
$$

##### Non-uniform circular motion

If a particle has non-constant speed, the particle has a perpendicular component of acceleration, $a_{tan}$, which is tangential to the circle

$a$ is the resultant of the two accelerations

$$
 a = \sqrt{a_{c}^2 + a_{tan}^2 } 
$$

##### Law of circular motion

$$
\sum F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{R} 
$$

##### Laws of angular motion

- $s$ is the arc/distance moved
- $\theta$ is the angle in radians of the arc moved
- $R$ is the distance in m to the centre of the motion
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity in rad/s
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration in rad/s${}^2$

$$
\theta = \frac{s}{R} 
$$

$$
 \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
$$

$$
 \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} 
$$

- with constant acceleration: 

$$
 \omega = \alpha t 
$$

$$
 \theta = \omega t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 
$$

$$
 \omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta 
$$

##### Relations with linear motion

$$
 v = R\omega 
$$

$$
 a_{tan} = R\alpha 
$$

$$
 a_c = \omega^2 R 
$$

##### Energy in angular motion

The moment of inertia of masses rotating around a fixed axis is

$$
 I_{sys} = \sum (m_iR_i^2) 
$$

For common bodies

For objects in motion AND rotation

$$
 K.E = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 
$$

conservation of energy in rolling motion

$$
 P_{top} + K_{trans_{top}} + K_{rot_{top}} = P_{bottom} + K_{trans_{bottom}} + K_{rot_{bottom}}
$$

##### Torque

$$
 \uptau = Fl 
$$

Where $l$ is the perpendicular distance from axis of rotation

$$
 \sum \uptau = I\alpha 
$$

Work and power from a torque are

$$
 W = \uptau \Delta \theta 
$$

$$
 P = \uptau \omega 
$$

##### Angular momentum

$$
 L = I\omega = mRv 
$$

- in the absence of external torques, angular momentum is conserved. It may be helpful when when a body's inertia changes

$$
 I_f\omega_f = I_i\omega_i 
$$
