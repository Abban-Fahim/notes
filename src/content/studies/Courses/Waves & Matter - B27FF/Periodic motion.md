Any motion that repeats itself over time is *periodic motion*. For it to occur, there must be a **restoring force**, which acts on the object towards the **equilibrium point**. 

A simple idea can be used to understand the forces involved in periodic motion - a mass connected to a fixed spring, on a frictionless surface: 
1. When stretched out, the spring will exert a restoring force, $F_{x}$, back towards its fixed point
2. The magnitude of $F_x$ (and hence acceleration caused by it, $a_x$) will decrease as the spring approaches its original stationary state
3. At stationary point (which happens to be the point of equilibrium), both $F_{x}$ and $a_x$ are equal to 0
4. However the velocity, $v_x$, of the mass has not decreased because no deacceleration occurred (no friction), and the mass overshoots and keeps moving at the same speed
5. Upon overshooting, $F_x$ now acts in the opposite direction, and the mass deaccelerates, until $v_{x}$ is 0 (which is the same distance from equilibrium as the initial displacement in the other direction)
6. Hence a periodic cycle occurs, where the mass *oscillates* between the two points forever (unless acted upon by an external force, $_{i\;got\;ya\;newton}$ ;D)
