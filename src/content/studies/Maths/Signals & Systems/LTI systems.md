A *linear time-invariant* system is defined as input-output system that is constrained to the input and output (both regarded as functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, being linearly mapped, and that the output is also not dependant on the particular time when the input is applied, hence for input $x(t-T)$, the output must be $y(t-T)$.

## Convolutions

A convolution is a mathematical operation, given as a function of time. To use it, we require input signal to the convolution

$$y(t)=x(t)*h(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{x(t)h(t-\lambda)\,d\lambda}$$

## Stability

To prove if a system is stable, we can check using the following inequality

$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{|h(t)|\,dt}<\infty$$

## Impulse and system response

The system's behaviour can be described using one function: the impulse response, $h(t)$. Mathematically, it is the vale the input is convoluted with to get the output

$$y(t)=x(t)*h(t)$$

It is called the impulse response since when $x(t)=\delta(t)$, it causes $y(t)=h(t)$. In the frequency domain, $H(s)$ is called the system response or transfer function, and is defined as such

$$H(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}$$

## Poles and zeros

The system response can be used to also identify important characteristics of a system without solving the entire equation, through its poles and zeros, defined in the numerator and denominator of $H(s)$ respectively

$$H(s)=\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}=K\frac{p_{m}s^{m}+p_{m-1}s^{m-1}+\dots+p_{0}}{z_{n}s^{n}+z_{n-1}s^{n-1}+\dots+z_{0}}$$

This gives us $m$ poles and $n$ zeros, where $K$ is a constant

## Stability

If all the poles lie on the negative side of the real axis, the system is stable for the entire ROC. If even a single pole is on the positive real side, the system is no longer stable. Additionally, the degree of $N(s)$ must be less than $D(s)$. If only one pole, or pole pair, has $\Re(p)=0$, the system is considered marginally stable.

For discrete systems ($z$ domain), the ROC is defined by a unit circle, $|z|=1$. Stability is achieved when the poles are inside the circle, hence $|z|<1$, and unstable otherwise.

## Shannon's sampling theorem

A **band-limited** signal is only greater than zero within a bandwidth of $\omega_{m}//f_{m}$, and its time-domain signal can be uniquely determined from its samples at a sampling time $T_{s}$, where $f_{s}>2f_{m}$. If $f_{s}$ is not twice size of $f_{m}$, then the samples will overlap and you will lose information on the receiving end. This minimum $2f_{m}$ is called the *Nyquist rate*, and its inverse the interval.
## Aliasing

Aliasing has a predictable behaviour, which does not allow information to be recovered, but it can be modelled nonetheless:
- if $f_m<\frac{f_{s}}{2}$, no aliasing occurs and the output contains $f_{m}$
- if $\frac{f_{s}}{2}<f_{m}<f_{s}$, the output contains the largest tone of $f_{s}-f_{m}$
- if $f_{s}<f_{m}<\frac{3f_{s}}{2}$, the output contains the largest tone if $f_{m}-f_{s}$

We can use an anti-aliasing, which is a low-pass filterq with a cutoff $f_{c}=\frac{f_{s}}{2}$, to cancel signals when $f_{m}$ exceeds $\frac{f_{s}}{2}$, giving us an output of 0 in all cases but the first. It must be placed right before the ADC in any signal transmission pipeline.

## Series and parallel systems

Systems in series have an effective system response as a product of their individual responses, while for parallel systems it is a summation.

## Feedback loop

When the input to the system $H(s)$ has output feedback through the system $G(s)$ subtracted from it, the equivalent closed loop system response is given as

$$Q(s)=\frac{H(s)}{1+H(s)G(s)}$$
