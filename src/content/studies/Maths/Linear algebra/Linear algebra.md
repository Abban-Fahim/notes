Multi-dimensional, real-valued systems that are linear, hence very convenient to compute with (rarely as useful in the applied sciences though). A lot of the credit goes to [3Blue1Brown's introductory series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=B0PAgYERCqROi-rh) on this topic.
