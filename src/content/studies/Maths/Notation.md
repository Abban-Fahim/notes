## Sets

A collection of mathematical objects, which can be defined with the a special set of operators. If $x$ is an element of the set $S$, we write it as $x\in{S}$, the operator roughly meaning *is in*. If every element of $A$ is also an element in $B$, then we say A is a *subset* of B, written as $A\subseteq{B}$, and if $A$ is not the exact same as $B$ then we can further call it a *proper* subset of $B$, written as $A\subset{B}$.

Sets can be operated, some commons one include,
- negation which contains all elements in the universal set except those in the negated set, where $A'$ is the negated set of $A$
- union of two sets containing elements of both sets, with no duplicates, where $A\cup{B}$ is the union of $A$ and $B$
- intersection of two sets containing only elements found in both sets, where $A\cap{B}$ is the intersection of $A$ and $B$

Some common sets are written in the blackboard bold style, in ascending order of (infinite) size include,
- $\mathbb{N}$ as the set of all natural numbers (positive counting numbers without fractional parts, start from 0 or 1)
- $\mathbb{Z}$ as the set of all integers (0 and negations of natural numbers)
- $\mathbb{Q}$ as the set of all rational numbers (integers, and fractional numbers that can be represented by a ratio of integers)
- $\mathbb{R}$ as the set of all real numbers (including all rational and irrational quantities)
- $\mathbb{C}$ as the set of$ all complex numbers, which can be described as $a+jb$, where $j=\sqrt{-1}$ and $a,b\in{\mathbb{R}}$

Some notations in linear algebra include defining multidimensional sets, which are described as a tuple containing $n$ elements from a set a $S$, given as $S^{n}$. For example the set of all possible Cartesian coordinates in 3D Euclidean space is given as $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. $O(n)$ is the set of orthogonal transformations (commonly as $n\times{n}$ matrices) in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, while $SO(n)$ refers to a *special* subset where all matrices have a determinant of 1. For example, $SO(3)$ is used for describing orientations (and rotations) in 3D space. $SE(3)$ defines  all the possible transformations, which can also be represented using a 4x4 matrix.
