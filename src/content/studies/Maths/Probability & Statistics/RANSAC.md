Stands for "Random Sample Consensus", and is an approach for filtering outliers from a random sample. It can deal with a high percentage of outlier sets. The first step is to chose a small (minimum) number, $S$, of samples and assume they are inliers. We then design a model for $S$ data points, where we consider them as perfect inliers. We then score the rest of the sample, with a set threshold, and evaluate what fraction of them agree with the model.
