Definitely my favourite subject, first instilled by the works [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and  [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), who opened my eyes to understanding maths as a fundamental science rather than just a tool or school subject, and explaining the motivation behind what we learn. The topics here are alas selected by the limits of my free time and my needs in understanding mechanics, machine learning, computer vision and robotics research. While, I chose not to pursue maths as an endeavour on its own before starting university, I do hope to one day deepen my understanding, and relive my childhood fascination. 

The notes are here are organised loosely into the fundamental branches of maths, and signals and systems, which while strictly is a branch of electrical engineering, utilise a plethora of mathematical tools that I learned through it, and for the sake of organisation included it here.
