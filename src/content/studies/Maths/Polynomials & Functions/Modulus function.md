This function, also known as **absolute**, returns the positive value of the input.

$$
|x| =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		x  & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
		-x & \text{if } x < 0
	\end{array}
\right.

$$

Some properties of the modulus function include:

$$
|a|^2 = a^2
$$

$$
|a| = |b| \Leftrightarrow a^{2} = b^{2} 
$$

$$
|a| > |b| = a^{2} > b^{2} 
$$

In addition to the above, you can use these to solve equations involving modulus

$$
|f(x)| = g(x)
$$

$$
f(x)= g(x), \; -g(x)
$$

To solve inequalities with modulus, we define two additional relations

$$
|a|\le b \Leftrightarrow -b \le a \le b 
$$

$$
|a|\ge b \Leftrightarrow a\le -b , \; a \ge b 
$$
