Decomposing algebraic fractions into a sum of proper fractions has many uses. A proper fraction is where the degree of the polynomial in denominator is greater to the degree of the polynomial in numerator, while an improper fraction is vice versa.

When the denominator has two distinct linear factors:

$$
\frac{px+q}{(ax+b)(cx+d)}=\frac{A}{ax+b}+\frac{B}{cx+d}
$$

This rule can be extended for any number of linear factors, with the number of factors equal to the number of final fractions.

For a repeated linear factor in the denominator:

$$
\frac{px+q}{(ax+b)^{2}}=\frac{A}{ax+b}+\frac{B}{(ax+b)^{2}}
$$

For a quadratic and linear factor in the denominator:

$$
\frac{px+q}{(ax+b)(cx^{2}+d)}=\frac{A}{ax+b}+\frac{Bx+C}{cx^{2}+d}
$$

The last case for improper fractions, which must first be split into the sum of a polynomial and proper fraction by [[Maths/Polynomials & Functions/Factorising polynomials|Factorising polynomials]], with $Q(x)$ being the quotient polynomial, $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ being the numerator and denominator, and $R(x)$ being the remainder of the division. We express the answer of division as:

$$
\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=Q(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}
$$

We can then factorise the proper fraction $\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}$
