We can estimate the range in which the root of an equation lies by searching for a **sign change**. If a that function's value changes from negative to positive from $x=a$ to $x=b$, then:

$$
a\lt\alpha\lt{b}
$$

To find the solution using a numerical method, we must rearrange the function into the form $x=F(x)$, where $F(x)$ is a converging function. If it is not convergent, this method will fail to work. Then we can use the following relation to find the root, with higher values of $n$ giving more accurate values of $x$:

$$
x_{n+1}=F(x_{n})
$$
